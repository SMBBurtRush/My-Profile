  <h1> About Me </h1>
  <p>I was born in Australia with both English and Scandinavian heritage. Like most Australians, I’m unfortunately monolingual, although my daughter and I are currently learning some Mandarin. I can also read enough Italian to cook Italian-language recipes (I’m highly motivated by pasta!). My previous degrees include a Bachelor of Arts with a major in Archaeology and Classics; a Master of Teaching; and a Bachelor of Food Science and Nutrition. It will perhaps not surprise you to hear that I work as an administration officer and put most of my energy into my hobbies. I live in flat overlooking a duck pond with my daughter and a particularly angry Chihuahua. </p>
