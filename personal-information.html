  <h2>Interpretation on Results</h2>
    <h3>What do the results of these tests mean for me?</h3>
    <p> There are long-standing critiques of both the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1170497" target="_blank">Myers-Briggs</a> and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1539-6053.2009.01038.x" target="_blank">Learning Styles </a> assessments – neither has a foundation in research and there is little evidence that adhering to either improves outcomes in educational or work settings. However, reflecting on the results can bring to light strengths and weaknesses that may not have previously been articulated. </p>
    <p><strong>Myers-Briggs</strong> was accurate in its assessment that I am introverted but assertive when necessary. It also classed me as open-minded, curious, empathetic, decisive, and organised. While I do identify with these qualities, the overwhelming focus on strengths made Myers-Briggs less useful to me as a reflective tool.</p>
    <p><strong> Learning Styles</strong> identified my preferred learning methods as tactile and visual – which encompasses everything from reading a book on a topic to building a working example of it (that is, most types of education). It also identified ‘auditory’ as a learning preference, which I found rather bemusing as I use hearing aids to help with an Auditory Processing Disorder. I found very little to reflect on in this test.</p>
    <p><strong> IPIP BIG Five Factor Markers</strong> was far less flattering and, perhaps unsurprisingly, consequently more useful. It is also the only one of the three with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1041608008000587" target="_blank"> some grounding in research </a>. It correctly identified my introversion; and agreed with the Myers-Briggs that I was agreeable, conscientious and curious. However, while Myers-Briggs declared me to be ‘empathetic’, IPIP BIG Five instead gave me a low score for ‘Emotional stability’. My empathy is a definite strength, but I am also aware that caring deeply about things can also make me inflexible and even confrontational. These are qualities I am currently working on, so it is good that this test accurately identified these as potential weaknesses. </p>

  <h3> How might the personality traits described in these assessments effect my work on a team?</h3>
    <p>These test results highlighted some of my strengths as a teammate. Both Myers-Briggs and IPIP BIG Five identified that I am agreeable, I work hard to get along with my teammates, and I endeavour to understand different strengths and points of view. These two tests also had in common the observation that I was conscientious. This is a double-edged sword though, as I can be frustrated by teammates who I perceive not be working as hard. This is a quality I am working on. I am also mindful that the ‘emotional instability’ highlighted in the IPIP BIG Five assessment arises from caring deeply about my work and projects I am involved in. I am learning that not all teammates will (or even need) to share that level of interest in the project for it to be successful. This understanding is something I will need to bring to team tasks in this subject.
    </p>

  <h3> How will I take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
    <p>One factor that both the Myers-Briggs and IPIP BIG Five tests both identified is that I am conscientious and organised. I enjoy my work best with people who share those characteristics. In previous courses, I’ve been lucky enough to end up in a few groups like that which were tremendously productive. I do acknowledge that this can lead me to be intolerant of people with very different work styles, such as those who prefer to leave things to the last minute., which is something I am working on. Having said that, I do think that working with similarly organised and motivated peers would be a good fit for me when forming a team.
