    <h2>A description of this role, including what makes it appealing to me</h2>
    <p> This is a web development job, in which the successful applicant would be responsible for the creation of websites that meet clients’ needs. The successful applicant would work with clients across the lifespan of the project, from understanding their requirements to delivering the functioning product.
This position is appealing to me for three reasons. The first is that I am passionate about the ability of the internet to communicate information; making ideas, products and services accessible to a greater variety of people. I’ve found that I work best in roles where I have a strong intrinsic motivation. Secondly, I enjoy the idea of dealing with different challenges on each project for each new client. The idea of maintaining the one website or system for a particular company is less exciting to me as it seems there would be less impetus for ongoing skill development. Finally, as a single parent and a carer I am very interested in positions that allow working from home or other workplace flexibility. I am a hard worker and never miss a deadline, so I am well suited to work environments where I largely supervise myself. </p>

    <h2>The skills, qualifications and experience I currently have, relative to the previous list</h2>
    <p>I currently have many of the non-IT skills that would be needed in a role like this one. I have very strong written and verbal communication, and good interpersonal skills. With an early career background in retail and marketing, I am comfortable working closely with clients and other stakeholders. I am actively working to improve my ability to handle conflicts in teams, to achieve outcomes where not only does the work get done but the team comes out of the conflict with a stronger motivation and shared understanding.
At present, I do not have any of the IT-specific skills listed, or any experience in the IT industry. </p>

    <h2>My plan to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required</h2>
    <p> As someone who is new to IT, the skills I need for this position are exclusively IT skills.</p>
    <table>
    </table>
    <p> Most importantly, I intend to practice these skills building and maintaining a website for my current freelance work in another field.
Once I have achieved some proficiency, I hope to offer my skills to community groups that I am involved with to build and maintain their websites.
I recognise that the best way to learn programming skills is to use them. </p>
