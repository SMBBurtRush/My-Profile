  <h1> Project Idea: Your Ausome Classroom </h1>

  <h2> Overview</h2>
    <p>This will be a free app available for teachers called “Your Ausome Classroom”. It will help teachers access high-quality strategies for making their classroom inclusive for their autistic students.  The app will be available on iPhone, Android and as a web app. It will include strategies that can be used at a classroom level (such as making the classroom sensory-friendly); and also, strategies that can be used to build rapport with individual autistic students (such as communication strategies for autistic students with a Pathological Demand Avoidance presentation).  All included strategies will be both evidence-based and endorsed by autistic adults.
    </p>

  <h2> Motivation </h2>
    <p>An increasing number of people in Australia are <a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/disability/autism-in-australia/contents/about" target="_blank"> being diagnosed as autistic</a>, many of them children. While this is often a very exciting time where children and their families can learn more about their identity and needs, there are also challenges. For instance, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08856257.2021.1878659" target="_blank">many teachers are finding themselves unsure </a> of how to best work with their autistic students. There is a lot of information out there and it can be difficult for busy educators to determine which information is high-quality. An easy-to-navigate app with vetted high-quality teaching strategies would fill a clear need. As an autistic adult, I am passionate about improving educational outcomes and social inclusion for autistic children.
    </p>

  <h2> Description</h2>
    <p> There are many free high-quality resources available for teachers to help them meet the needs of their autistic students, such as <a href="https://www.education.vic.gov.au/school/teachers/learningneeds/Pages/supportmaterials.aspx" target="_blank"> the classroom design resources from the Victorian Department of Education </a>, the <a href="https://www.autism.org.au/our-services/school-age/online-resources/for-teachers-and-educators/" target="_blank"> visual supports downloadable from the Autism Association of Western Australia </a>, and the <a href="https://www.mywayemployability.com.au/help" target="_blank"> autism-specific careers counselling tool myWAY Employability</a>.</p>
    <p> However, these resources are scattered around the internet and not readily accessible during a busy teaching day. My Ausome Classroom would summarise, organise, and where necessary link to, these free resources so that all teachers can quickly use a school or personal device to access reliable, actionable strategies.  </p>
    <p> The app would contain the following categories, each of which would then be organised into pages based around smaller sub-categories, and then a page for each resource or strategy (for example Sensory strategies > Strategies for students who avoid noise > Making sure that all electronics in the classroom are in good working order and not producing unusual noise). </p>
    <p> <em>Sensory strategies</em> – Most autistic people are hypo- or hyper-sensitive to one or more senses. <a href="https://www.education.vic.gov.au/Documents/school/teachers/teachingresources/diversity/sensoryprocesstable.docx" download> Simple strategies (.doc will download)</a> such as reducing visual clutter in the classroom or allowing a student to wear sunglasses may reduce student distress, increase their concentration, and decrease behaviours of concern. </p>
    <p> <em>Communication and relationship-building strategies</em> – There is a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1750946721000179" target="_blank">significant body</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aur.2611" target="_blank"> of research </a> that indicates communication problems often arise between autistic people and neurotypical people. This can lead to relationship breakdown between autistic students and neurotypical students without either intending it. Strategies such as giving verbal instructions one at a time to an autistic student (understanding that multiple sequential instructions make many autistic people feel rushed) may improve these relationships and lead to less conflict in the classroom.</p>
    <p> <em> Subject-specific strategies </em> – Autistic people, particularly when they are younger, may have difficulty concentrating on topics unrelated to their current interests; or (even if not intellectual disabled) may have deficits in areas like working memory or pragmatic language. Subject-specific strategies show teachers ways to communicate their topics to all students in a way they can understand – such as <a href="https://www.education.vic.gov.au/Documents/school/teachers/teachingresources/diversity/accommathsecondary.docm" download> using concrete materials to teach each new maths concept (.doc will dowload)</a>, even in upper secondary. </p>
    <p> <em>Work and life skills resources </em> – Schools, as the place that most children and teenagers spend their days, are by default also instructors in many work and life skills. Tools specifically created to explain these skills in an autistic communication style prevent autistic students from disengaging and potentially becoming disruptive in these sessions. For example, <a href="https://www.mywayemployability.com.au/help" target="_blank">the myWAY Employability tool</a> breaks down careers counselling into single specific tasks in clear, unambiguous language. It covers things that autistic people are concerned about, such as noise levels in different workplaces, that may not even occur to neurotypical teachers and students. </p>
    <p> This app would be free, because it based on resources created by third-party (primarily governmental) agencies, and because teachers should not incur additional costs to make their classrooms more accessible. Potential funding pathways include a grant from the Australian Government Department of Social Services’ <a href="https://www.dss.gov.au/disability-and-carers-programs-services-for-people-with-disability/information-linkages-and-capacity-building-ilc-program" target="_blank"> Information Linkages and Capacity Building (ILC) program</a>. This program has previously funded similar projects such as <a href="https://www.mywayemployability.com.au/help" target="_blank"> the Self Manager Hub</a>, which collates resources from government departments and non-profit organisations.</p>

    <h2>Tools and Technologies </h2>
    <p> A simple app like My Ausome Classroom could be developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started" target="_blank"> React Native</a> (an open-source framework) could be used to turn a webpage built with these tools into an app that would run on any platform, including Android and iOS.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, a basic understanding of Git and GitHub would be necessary to develop this product effectively as a team.</p>
    <p>To make this app available to teachers would require a server to host the app content. It would also need to be available on commonly used app stores for both Android and iOS. </p>

    <h2>Skills Required</h2>
    <p>Before using React the following skills are required:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>Basic JavaScript</li>
      <li>JSX (a JavaScript syntax extension)</li>
    </ul>

      <p>HTML, CSS and beginner JavaScript courses are abundant. I am <a href="ideal-job.html">already undertaking two free, online courses that cover the first two of these elements</a>. React, including JSX, has a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html" target="_blank">detailed document library</a> and <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html" target="_blank"> tutorial </a>.
      <p>A GitHub account would be required, as would the CLI or a CLI emulator like Git Bash (both of which I already have). </a>
      <p>No particular hardware is required to develop this project, or paid software, making it a good entry-level project. However, a significant time investment is required to build the skills outlined above for someone new to programming. </a>

    <h2>If the Project is Successful…</h2>
    <p>To make this project successful would require marketing it, and professional development for teachers. However due to the intuitive and simple nature of the app, professional development could ideally occur through short video tutorials available freely and on-demand. </p>
    <p>This project would open up a valuable line of communication between researchers working on autism and autistic adults on one hand; and teachers implementing classroom programs for autistic students on the other hand. The efficacy of this project would be judged based on better outcomes for autistic students in classes where the teachers were using the app, with markers including increased engagement/attendance, a greater number of tasks completed, and less of the school’s disciplinary measures used. </p>
