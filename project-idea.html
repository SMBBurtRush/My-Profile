  <h1> Project Idea: Your Ausome Classroom </h1>

  <h2> Overview<h2>
    <p>This will be a free app available for teachers called “Your Ausome Classroom”. It will help teachers access high-quality strategies for making their classroom inclusive for their autistic students.  The app will be available on iPhone, Android and as a web app. It will include strategies that can be used at a classroom level (such as making the classroom sensory-friendly); and also, strategies that can be used to build rapport with individual autistic students (such as communication strategies for autistic students with a Pathological Demand Avoidance presentation).  All included strategies will be both evidence-based and endorsed by autistic adults.
    </p>

  <h2> Motivation </h2>
    <p>An increasing number of people in Australia are <a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/disability/autism-in-australia/contents/about" target="_blank"> being diagnosed as autistic</a>, many of them children. While this is often a very exciting time where children and their families can learn more about their identity and needs, there are also challenges. For instance, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08856257.2021.1878659" target="_blank">many teachers are finding themselves unsure </a> of how to best work with their autistic students. There is a lot of information out there and it can be difficult for busy educators to determine which information is high-quality. An easy-to-navigate app with vetted high-quality teaching strategies would fill a clear need. As an autistic adult, I am passionate about improving educational outcomes and social inclusion for autistic children.
