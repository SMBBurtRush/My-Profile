   <h1>My Interest in IT</p>
   <h2> What is my interest in IT? When did it start?</h2>
     <p> My interest in IT started at school. I grew up in a small town, where the only ideas were those held by the people around you, in the books at the small public library, or that you saw on the TV. There were very few opportunities to learn new skills, explore the broader world or be exposed to different ways of thinking about things. And then the internet arrived! Suddenly, I could read about an amazing range of topics (despite the internet at that time being much, much narrower in scope than it is these days). I could see people who were different to me through their eyes, rather than the generally conservative lens of the people around me. It was a revelation. To this day, I love the potential of IT to be used to promote voices that go unheard in traditional media and to be used by individuals and community groups to solve problems for themselves.</p>
   <h2> Was there a person who sparked my interest in it?</h2>
     <p> My grandmother was an early adopter of home computing, gaming and the internet. She was also an early adopter of many other things, including being the second female accountant registered in Victoria and the first woman to have an office in Commerce House. Seeing her, even as a much older person, dive into each new technology helped me to grow up with the firm belief that IT is for everyone – not just boys or young people. She was an avid player of Mist, a prodigious digital artist, and a perpetual tinkerer with programs. She remains my inspiration to today.</p>
   <h2> My IT experience</h2>
     <p> My IT experience is currently limited to using the internet, making utilitarian administration documents in Word at work, and a die-hard love for Elder Scrolls Online. I realise that there is so many more ways that I could be better using technology in my private, family, community and professional life. This is my main motivation for undertaking this course. </p>
   <h2> Why did I choose to study at RMIT? </h2>
     <p> I chose to study IT at RIMIT because of the course offering through Open University. I completed a few other degrees when I was younger, but I’ve increasingly struggled to return to study to finish my last degree (a Masters of Dietetics) due to the inflexibility of the higher education institutions that offer it. We desperately need a greater range of life experience in many fields, but universities still often insist in on-campus attendance during the working day with a load of at least 2 subjects a semester. As a single parent, a disabled person, a carer, and someone who works during the day, this puts the majority of courses out of my reach. Which is frustrating, as this course so amply demonstrates that tertiary education can be presented in a more flexible way. I’m hoping to go into web development and I think that disabled people such as myself have a lot of relevant experience to making websites more universally accessible. That’s why I am excited to be studying at RMIT where my potential contribution isn’t discounted by structural factors before I can even apply for the course. </p>
   <h2> What do I hope to learn? </h2>
     <p> I am keen to get a general grounding in the IT industry and to understand more fully both the career options and the emerging issues in IT. On a personal note, I am very keen to learn web development skills, as a potential future career. I have already learned in this subject that these skills will include html, CSS and Java. But there are also other areas, such as security, which are highly relevant and which I would like to learn more about as well. In addition to this, I want to learn some basic programming so that I can automate annoying computing processes (mainly revolving around endless home admin!) and perhaps even make some tools to serve my community. For instance, there is no easy, modern NDIS self-management app – despite there being <a href="https://www.ndis.gov.au/news/6450-see-ndis-action-latest-quarterly-report" target="_blank"> 449,900 NDIS participants </a> and the NDIS <a href="https://www.ndis.gov.au/about-us/history-ndis" target="_blank"> having been around for nine years now </a>. Issues like this are well known in the disability community but just not being addressed because as a group we are <a href="https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/140986" target="_blank"> under-resourced and under-skilled </a>. I realise I’m asking a lot from one degree, but I am prepared to put in the hard work and undertake self-studies outside of the coursework as well </p>
